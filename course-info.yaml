summary: "<div>\r\n<div>You will practice concepts frequently tested in technical\
  \ interviews at top tech companies.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Always wanted to have your private\
  \ movie theater and screen only the movies you like? You can buy a fancy projector\
  \ and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets? The idea of a ticket\
  \ booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that! Make good\
  \ use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell\
  \ and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn,\
  \ please!</p>\r\n</div><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href=\"https://hyperskill.org/projects/189?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card\"\
